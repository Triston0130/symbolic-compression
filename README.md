## Symbolic Compression Engine

**`.sym` is the `.json` of structured cognition.**  
This system compresses symbolic sequences using recursive emergence logic, not statistical redundancy.

Unlike traditional data formats that describe static structure, `.sym` files encode **how structure arises**—from initial conditions, recurrence intervals, and symbolic curvature fields.

Powered by **Miller's Law** of symbolic deviation, this engine extracts recurrence rules, detects collapse zones, and stores entire symbolic generative systems in compact, interpretable `.sym` files.

Whether you're modeling primes, Fibonacci-like structures, square-free sequences, or custom symbolic domains—this tool compresses, predicts, and regenerates symbolic intelligence itself.

## Key Features

- Recurrence-based symbolic compression  
- Predictive reconstruction of emergent sequences  
- Multi-zone `.sym` file storage  
- Domain-agnostic: number theory, logic, perception, AI  
- Command-line interface for batch processing  
- Patent-pending technology: U.S. Application No. 63/786,260

## Why `.sym`?

- **`.json` stores static trees.**  
- **`.sym` stores recursive emergence.**  

This system is the foundation for **cognitive data formats**, symbolic AI memory, and next-generation compression across irreducible domains.

## Quick Start

### Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/symbolic-compression.git
cd symbolic-compression
```

### Compress a symbolic sequence using built-in rules:

```bash
python symbolic_cli.py compress fibonacci --length 20 --output fib.sym
```

### Collapse a symbolic sequence (e.g. primes) into multi-zone form:

```bash
python symbolic_cli.py collapse --output primes.sym --segment-length 5
```

### Predict from a `.sym` file:

```bash
python symbolic_cli.py predict primes.sym --output regenerated.txt
```

## Example `.sym` File (Human-Readable)

```json
{
  "format": "symbolic-collapse-v2",
  "type": "multi-zone",
  "rules": [
    {
      "x0": 2,
      "delta0": 1,
      "kappa": 1.5,
      "N": 5
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "domain": "collapse",

  }
}
```
